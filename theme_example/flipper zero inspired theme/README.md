#The boot animation is in 320x170, the icons are 320x145 due to the battery icon on the top.\
\
#To use the Icon pack, simply dump the two files into an sd card, then on T-Embed go to Settings > UI theme > SD Card > orangetheme > theme.json\
\
#There are two .json items, one starts with \'93 ._ \'93 which you should not use, \'93theme.json\'94 one should be clicked.\
\
#For the boot animation, go to Files > SD Card  > boots > boot.gif \
\
#Once again two items will appear, use the one that says \'93boot.gif\'94 \
\
#Scroll down until you see \'93 Copy->LittleFS \'93 and click on it. A red round bar will fill\
